## Overview

Welcome to the Weaviate **Quickstart tutorial**. 

Here, you will get a hands-on experience using Weaviate to get an idea of some of its key features.

By the end, you will end up with a simple, but fully functioning vector database. 

## Before you start 

The guide assumes that you are somewhat familiar with databases and vector embeddings. 

But don't worry too much even if you are uncomfortable with any of these. The guide is structured so you should be able to follow along even if some of the concepts are unfamiliar. And you can always revisit some of these ideas in the documentation. 

## Next

Get started by [installing Weaviate](./installation.md).
